    <h2 class="list_headings">My Gaming Experience</h2>
	  <p>Like many kids, I was crazy about video games growing up. This doesn't mean I spent all of my time inside, but I wasn't one to complain about a rainy day. I bought my first gaming console of my own at 12: and XBox 360, with Halo 2 being my first game. From there, I was hooked.</p>

    <h2 class="list_headings">My PC Gaming Experience</h2>
	  <p>I didn't get into PC gaming until the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. I started streaming in late 2019 with my P4, but I wanted to be able to customize my stream and make it more aesthetically pleasing. I bought a cheap prebuilt PC that was capable of gaming at 1080p and streaming at 720p. But it wasn't enough; I wanted better performance and a full high-definition stream. So, I started working on upgrading my PC.</p>

    <h2 class="list_headings">My PC Building Experience</h2>
	  <p>The first upgrade I made to my PC was a new graphics card. I quickly learned I needed a new processor to support the better GPU. So I bought one. Then I realized I needed a better motherboard. Then better and more RAM. And more power. And more storage. And better airflow. The list goes on and on. I made mistakes along the way as well. I plugged in a RAM stick while the power was still on (oops) and fried my motherboard, RAM, and power supply. So I replaced all of that. Evetually, my prebuilt PC had none of its original parts left over. Then I sold it and started over. Now, I have one of the coolest looking, best performing PCs that many of my friends have seen!</p>
