# My Github account is used to create and display my work on my college portfolio project.
# The repository I created contains html files, images and css rules created to make the website for my project.
# I created the repository in Github, then tied my Github desktop to my Github account. From here, I was able to clone the repository to my files in the left-hand colmun of the Github desktop. After adding my files to the repository and publishing my changes, the website was able to be viewed on a browser!
